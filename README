Fuzzee.vim will tab-complete paths relative to the current working directory in Vim and also the current buffer for use with `:e[dit]`, `:E[xplore]`, and many other splitting options. It also ignores files, directories, and filetypes listed in the user-defined `wildignore` setting. Finally, it's on-demand multi-directory globbing and has support for custom path mappings.

:F itself opens up the explorer.

:F ./ will always refer to the current working directory.

:F * will glob multiple directories from the current buffer.

:F {arg} will search the buffer and current working directory for a fuzzy match of {arg}.

:FB searches for any open or hidden buffers using the 'switchbuf' setting.

:FuzzeeMap {cmap} {path} creates a custom 'cmap' per-directory to use in conjunction with the :F command.

Supports splits, tabs, :lcd and :cd with fuzzy-arguments.
