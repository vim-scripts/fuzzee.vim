Fuzzee.vim will tab-complete paths relative to the current working directory in Vim and also the current buffer for use with :e[dit] and :E[xplore]. It also ignores files, directories, and filetypes listed in the user-defined wildignore setting.

:F itself opens up the explorer.

:F ./ will always refer to the current working directory.

:F * will glob multiple directories from the current buffer.

:F {arg} will search the buffer and current working directory for a fuzzy match of {arg}.

Supports splits, tabs, :lcd and :cd with fuzzy-arguments.

Read the README for more tips on usage.
